  # that we can set some additional defaults that are more friendly to the servlet
  # environment, but still can be overridden by the application in the Rails
  # initializer.
  #
  # Only for Rails 2.0, unfortunately. This code is mildly evil, but we're hoping
  # the Rails booter code won't change too much.
